# Payment System Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Payment and PaymentResult pages for the ecommerce Vue.js application.

## Overview

Two new pages have been implemented to handle the payment flow:

1. **PaymentView.vue** - Payment form page for collecting payment and shipping information
2. **PaymentResultView.vue** - Payment result page for handling payment completion

## Implementation Details

### 1. PaymentView.vue (`/payment`)

**Purpose**: Allows users to fill in payment methods, shipping methods, and shipping address before creating an order.

**API Integration**:
- Uses `POST /orders/me` endpoint
- Sends `CreateOrderRequest` with required fields:
  - `paymentMethod`: CREDIT_CARD, PAYPAL, or LINE_PAY
  - `shippingMethod`: Shipping option (STANDARD, EXPRESS, OVERNIGHT)
  - `shippingAddress`: Full delivery address
  - `tradeDesc`: Optional order description

**Features**:
- Form validation for all required fields
- Payment method selection (Credit Card, PayPal, LINE Pay)
- Shipping method selection with pricing
- Free shipping for orders over NT$1,000
- Order summary showing cart items and totals
- Integration with existing cart and product stores
- Automatic address pre-fill from user profile

**Flow**:
1. User navigates from cart page
2. Form validates required fields
3. Order created via API
4. Cart cleared on success
5. Redirects to payment result page

### 2. PaymentResultView.vue (`/payment-result`)

**Purpose**: Handles the payment processing and displays results to the user.

**API Integration**:
- Uses `POST /payments/checkout` endpoint
- Sends `PaymentCheckoutRequest` with:
  - `orderId`: Order ID from previous step
  - `amount`: Total payment amount
  - `itemName`: Order description
  - `tradeDesc`: Transaction description

**Features**:
- Processing state with loading animation
- Success state with order confirmation
- Error state with retry functionality
- Order details display
- Navigation options (view orders, continue shopping)

**Flow**:
1. Receives order data from payment page
2. Initiates payment processing
3. Shows loading state
4. Displays success/error result
5. Provides navigation options

### 3. API Service Integration

Added new payment API methods to `services/api.js`:

```javascript
export const paymentApi = {
  // Process payment checkout
  async checkout(paymentData) {
    return apiRequest('/payments/checkout', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(paymentData),
    })
  },
}
```

### 4. Router Configuration

Added protected routes to `router/index.js`:

```javascript
{
  path: '/payment',
  name: 'payment',
  component: () => import('../views/PaymentView.vue'),
  beforeEnter: requireAuth,
},
{
  path: '/payment-result',
  name: 'payment-result',
  component: () => import('../views/PaymentResultView.vue'),
  beforeEnter: requireAuth,
}
```

### 5. Cart Integration

Updated `CartView.vue` to navigate to the payment page:

```javascript
const proceedToCheckout = () => {
  router.push('/payment')
}
```

## Security Features

- Both payment pages are protected by authentication guards
- API requests include authentication tokens
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Error handling for API failures

## UI/UX Design

- Consistent with existing application design patterns
- Uses TailwindCSS for styling
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading states and error handling
- Clear navigation flow

## API Schema Compliance

The implementation follows the API specifications:

- **CreateOrderRequest**: Includes all required fields (paymentMethod, shippingMethod, shippingAddress)
- **PaymentCheckoutRequest**: Includes orderId, amount, itemName, tradeDesc
- **Error Handling**: Properly handles API response errors

## Testing

- Authentication guards verified (redirects to login when not authenticated)
- Form validation tested
- API integration points implemented
- UI components render correctly

## Future Enhancements

1. Real payment gateway integration (ECPay, etc.)
2. Order tracking functionality
3. Payment method storage for returning customers
4. Advanced shipping options
5. Order confirmation emails
